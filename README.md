# Dog Breed Identification Challenge

This repository contains the jupyter notebook for the dog breed identification challenge for the class CSI4106.
Please run this notebook in colaboratory.


The model.zip file is provided in a brightspace submission link, because it is too large to keep on github. My report for this project is also there.


Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions regarding this notebook.
